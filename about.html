    <div class="info">Hi, I'm Abhishek Naik from Squad 50. I'm excited to share my latest project: a dynamic bird shooting game developed using HTML5 Canvas. Inspired by the vibrant and interactive gameplay of the Zombie Shooter assignment, this game aims to deliver a thrilling and immersive experience.

        In this game, players will refine their marksmanship, reflexes, and strategic skills as they engage with a variety of animated birds. Featuring stunning visuals, intuitive controls, and a range of challenging scenarios, this game is designed to be both captivating and addictive.
        
        Stay tuned as I continue to develop and enhance this project, blending creativity with technology to offer an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience for all.
